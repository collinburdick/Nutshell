# Nutshell PRD — “The whole room, in a nutshell.”

**Author:** (You) Senior PM / Systems Architect
**Platform:** React Native mobile app + web-based Admin Console (recommended)
**Document Version:** 1.0 (Jan 15, 2026)

---

## 1) Executive Summary

### Product Vision

Nutshell is a **real-time conference intelligence platform** that captures breakout sessions and roundtables, **transcribes and de-identifies** dialogue, and delivers **instant thematic summaries** to facilitators and admins—at scale—without adding friction to the room.

### The Problem

Conferences generate high-value insights in small rooms: roundtables, workshops, breakouts. Today, that intelligence is:

* **Lost** (captured inconsistently via notes)
* **Biased** (who wrote the notes and what they missed)
* **Slow** (summaries take days/weeks)
* **Risky** (PII and sensitive remarks can leak)
* **Unscalable** (admins can’t monitor 25–250 tables)

### Goals (What “Great” Looks Like)

1. **Capture**: >90% of active tables produce usable transcript segments and summaries.
2. **Speed**: First coherent “local summary” delivered within **60–120 seconds** of session start.
3. **Privacy**: Near-zero PII leakage in exports (measurable via automated redaction tests + audits).
4. **Admin Control**: One admin can manage **100+ tables** with health monitoring, nudges, and pulse.
5. **Value Realization**: Post-event insights dashboard used by attendees/sponsors with >40% engagement.

### Non-Goals (Initial)

* Replacing full event registration platforms (we integrate instead).
* Perfect diarization (speaker recognition by identity). We use **de-identified speaker tags**.
* “Always-on” surveillance—Nutshell is explicitly session-based with consent patterns.

### Success Metrics (KPIs)

**Acquisition/Activation**

* Admin setup time for an event: median <15 minutes
* Facilitator join + mic sync completion rate >95%

**Quality**

* Summary satisfaction (facilitator thumbs-up) >80%
* Action item extraction precision target >70% (v1), >85% (v2)

**Latency**

* End-to-end pipeline latency (audio → transcript snippet) p95 <3s
* Audio → updated summary p95 <10–15s (rolling)

**Privacy**

* PII scrubbing recall >99% on benchmark suite
* Audit findings: 0 critical incidents

---

## 2) User Personas

### Persona A: Event Admin (Primary Buyer/User)

**Profile:** Conference producer, event ops lead, community manager
**Goals:**

* Stand up multi-session events quickly
* Monitor many rooms/tables at once
* Ensure timing consistency (nudges)
* Extract sponsor-ready insights fast
* Avoid privacy/legal issues
  **Pain Points:**
* Herding facilitators + inconsistent note capture
* No visibility until it’s too late
* Post-event reporting is manual + slow

### Persona B: Session Facilitator (Primary In-Room User)

**Profile:** Volunteer, staff moderator, partner facilitator
**Goals:**

* Start fast without accounts/passwords
* Stay on topic with guide + prompts
* See a live “what we’re hearing” summary
* Keep participants comfortable (privacy)
  **Pain Points:**
* Tech friction at session start
* Hard to synthesize discussion live
* Managing time and prompts while moderating

### Additional Personas (Recommended)

* **Attendee/Participant (Secondary):** Wants outcomes, themes, and next steps after sessions.
* **Sponsor/Partner Stakeholder:** Wants aggregate insights + sentiment without identities.
* **Compliance/Legal (Internal Stakeholder):** Needs retention controls, consent, auditability.

## 3) Product Principles

1. **Zero-friction start**: “Join with a code” should feel like scanning a QR at a restaurant.
2. **Human-first privacy**: De-identification is not a feature; it’s a default.
3. **Actionable in the moment**: Live summaries and nudges change outcomes *during* the session.
4. **Scale by design**: Monitoring 5 tables and 150 tables should feel similarly manageable.
5. **Trust through transparency**: Show what’s recorded, what’s scrubbed, and what’s shared.

---

## 4) Core Workflows (High Level)

### Facilitator Flow (2-minute setup)

1. Open Nutshell app → Enter **session code** (or scan QR)
2. App requests mic permission → “Quick-Sync” connects
3. Facilitator sees assigned table + topic + discussion guide
4. Live transcript snippets + rolling “local summary”
5. Receives admin nudges (time warnings, prompt changes)
6. Ends session → confirms “Wrap-up highlights” (optional)

### Admin Flow (Event setup → live ops → post-event)

1. Create event → add sessions/breakouts + table count + topics
2. Generate facilitator codes/QRs + share
3. Live Command Center: health, activity, pulse, issues
4. Push nudges to all or some tables
5. Post-event Insight Dashboard: themes, action items, questions, exports

---

## 5) Functional Requirements (Detailed)

### 5.1 Multi-Device “Quick-Sync” (No Formal Login)

**Objective:** Allow facilitators to join instantly via code and begin audio capture reliably.

**Requirements**

* **Join Methods**

  * Enter short code (6–8 chars) OR scan QR
  * “No account required” for facilitators (admins can use SSO)
* **Ephemeral Session Identity**

  * Code exchanges for a **short-lived token** bound to event + table + session window
  * Optional device nickname (“iPhone 14 – Table 7”)
* **Local Microphone Sync**

  * Minimal taps: Join → Allow mic → “Connected”
  * Real-time mic level meter + ambient noise indicator
* **Multi-Device Redundancy (Smart Addition)**

  * Allow **up to N devices per table** (e.g., 2) for redundancy or larger tables
  * Backend selects “best stream” (highest SNR) or merges when safe
* **Connectivity Resilience**

  * If network drops: buffer short audio locally (e.g., 60–120s) and backfill
  * Clear UI states: Connected / Degraded / Offline Buffering / Reconnected
* **Permissions + OS Constraints**

  * Must support iOS/Android mic permissions, background audio (if permitted)
  * “Screen-off mode” (keep recording while locked) where allowed

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Facilitator can join and begin streaming in <20 seconds median.
* <2% sessions fail to capture any audio due to sync issues.

---

### 5.2 Facilitator Interface (Mobile, Low Friction)

**Objective:** Keep facilitators focused on the room, not the phone.

**Core Screens**

1. **Join Screen**: code/QR, mic permission
2. **Session Home** (main):

   * Table topic + session title
   * Discussion guide (bulleted prompts)
   * Timer (start/end, plus agenda phases)
   * Live “Local Summary” (rolling, updated periodically)
   * “Capture Controls”: Pause/Resume (optional), End session
3. **Live Signals Panel**:

   * Connection health
   * Mic level
   * “Participants speaking distribution” (de-identified, approximate—optional)
4. **Wrap-Up**:

   * Quick confirm/edit: top 3 takeaways (suggested by AI)
   * Confirm action items & open questions (one-tap approve)

**UX Requirements**

* One-thumb layout, high contrast, large typography
* “Do Not Disturb” mode recommendation prompt on start
* Accessible (WCAG-aligned), multilingual UI strings

**Smart Additions**

* **Prompt Deck**: Admin can push a new prompt (“Shift to barriers”)
* **Hands-free mode**: Large “Start / End” buttons, minimal scrolling
* **Consent prompt**: “Reminder: session is recorded and de-identified” with optional script

---

### 5.3 Admin Command Center (Scale Operations)

**Objective:** Let a small team manage many live tables confidently.

**Recommended Form Factor**

* **Web app** for command center (large-screen operations)
* Optional lightweight admin view in the mobile app

**Core Capabilities**

* **Event Builder**

  * Create event → sessions → tables/topics
  * Bulk import topics via CSV
  * Assign facilitator codes and generate QR sheets
* **Live Monitoring Dashboard**

  * Total tables: Active / Inactive / Degraded / Offline
  * Per-table status: last audio received, transcript freshness, summary freshness
  * “Hot tables” (high activity, strong sentiment shifts, many action items)
* **Pulse Sentiment Analysis**

  * Aggregated sentiment per table (not per person)
  * Trend lines over time (e.g., excitement/confusion)
  * Confidence indicator (avoid over-trusting weak signals)
* **Intervention Tools**

  * Emergency nudges (see next section)
  * Table reassignment (if a facilitator switches tables)
  * “Session-wide announcement” banner
* **Content Views**

  * Live themes emerging across tables
  * Live action items list (deduped)
  * Live open questions list (deduped)

**Smart Additions**

* **Ops Playbooks**: one-click templates (“Workshop 45 min” with timed nudges)
* **Auto-escalation**: alert admin if table has no audio for >60s
* **Room Heatmap**: if venue mapping exists, show issues geographically

---

### 5.4 Emergency Nudge System (Instant Notifications)

**Objective:** Let admins coordinate timing and prompts across rooms in seconds.

**Requirements**

* Targeting:

  * All facilitators
  * Specific session
  * Specific tables
  * Tag-based groups (e.g., “Beginner track”)
* Message Types:

  * Time warnings (“5 minutes left”)
  * Prompt shift (“Move to solutions”)
  * Urgent ops (“AV issue—pause recording”)
* Delivery:

  * Push notifications + in-app banners
  * Offline fallback: show on reconnect; SMS fallback optional for critical events
* Confirmation:

  * Admin sees delivery stats (sent/delivered/opened)
  * Facilitator can “Acknowledge” (optional) without typing

**Guardrails**

* Rate limiting to prevent spam
* Pre-approved templates for speed and tone consistency

---

### 5.5 AI Insight Engine (Transcription → De-ID → Insights)

**Objective:** Convert live conversation into safe, useful intelligence in real time.

#### 5.5.1 Audio Processing & Transcription

* Streaming transcription with low latency
* Noise suppression + echo cancellation (device-level + optional server enhancements)
* Language detection; multilingual transcription (phased)
* Confidence scores per segment; drop low-confidence from summaries (or label)

#### 5.5.2 PII Scrubbing / De-identification

* Detect and redact:

  * Names, emails, phone numbers
  * Company names (configurable)
  * Addresses, URLs, social handles
  * Any custom patterns provided by event organizer (e.g., internal project codenames)
* Output:

  * Replace with tags: `[PERSON]`, `[EMAIL]`, `[ORG]` or generalized roles
* Modes (Admin-configurable):

  * **Strict** (default): aggressive redaction
  * **Balanced**: preserve more context
  * **Custom dictionary**: allow-list/deny-list terms
* Human review (post-event, optional):

  * Admin can review redactions before exporting externally

#### 5.5.3 Real-Time Summaries

* Per-table rolling summary updated every N seconds or after N tokens
* “What we’re hearing” + “What’s unresolved”
* Highlight contradictions and recurring themes

#### 5.5.4 Structured Extraction

* Action items: owner-less by default (to avoid identity leakage)
* Open questions: phrased as attendee-safe prompts
* Risks/concerns: grouped by category
* Quotes: **disabled by default** (privacy risk). If enabled, must be short and redacted.

**Smart Additions**

* **Insight Deduplication** across tables (cluster similar action items)
* **Theme Confidence + Evidence**: show supporting anonymized snippets (redacted)
* **Post-event Q&A**: chat interface that answers “What did people say about pricing?” using only de-identified data

---

### 5.6 Speaker Attribution (De-identified Dialogue Flow)

**Objective:** Preserve conversational structure without identifying participants.

**Requirements**

* Tag speakers as Speaker A/B/C… per table session
* Maintain tag consistency across a session when possible
* Do not attempt biometric identity or cross-session linking
* UI can optionally show “Speaker Count” and “Turn-taking balance” in aggregate (privacy-safe)

**Quality Constraints**

* If diarization confidence is low, degrade gracefully:

  * Combine into “Speaker 1/2” only, or omit speaker tags entirely

---

### 5.7 Integration & Export + Insight Dashboard

**Objective:** Turn event intelligence into action where teams already work.

#### 5.7.1 Insight Dashboard (Post-event)

Audience: attendees, sponsors, internal teams
Views:

* Executive themes overview
* Session-level and table-level insights (de-identified)
* Top action items + owners (manual assignment after export)
* Open questions
* Sentiment/pulse timeline
* Search and filter by topic, track, tag

Permissions:

* Admin controls what’s visible to attendees vs internal only
* Link-sharing with expiration; SSO for internal events

#### 5.7.2 One-click Export

* Slack: post to channels + threads (per session)
* Notion: create pages/databases with structured fields
* Salesforce: create notes/opportunities insights (B2B events), attach as activity

**Smart Additions**

* Webhooks + API for custom integrations
* Export “Insight Pack” PDF for sponsors (sanitized, branded)
* Data warehouse export (Snowflake/BigQuery) for enterprise customers

---

## 6) Technical Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Low-latency Targets (Suggested Budgets)

* Audio chunking: 250–500ms frames
* Network uplink buffering: <1–2s
* ASR streaming: p95 <3s per segment
* Summarization refresh: p95 <10–15s
* Admin dashboard refresh: <5s perceived

### 6.2 Privacy & Security Protocols

* Explicit consent model:

  * Event-level consent statement + facilitator script
  * Optional participant opt-out guidance (process defined per event)
* Data minimization:

  * Default: store transcript + insights; raw audio retention configurable (off by default for privacy-sensitive events)
* Encryption:

  * In transit: TLS
  * At rest: encrypted storage
* Access control:

  * RBAC for admins (Organizer, Ops, Analyst, Viewer)
  * Facilitators only access assigned table session
* Audit logs:

  * Who exported what, when, and to where
* Retention policies:

  * Configurable retention windows; auto-delete
* Compliance readiness:

  * SOC2-aligned controls, GDPR/CCPA considerations (depending on market)

### 6.3 React Native Mobile Constraints

* Must use native audio modules for reliable capture (RN bridge)
* Battery/thermal constraints:

  * Efficient encoding (Opus/AAC) and adaptive bitrate
* Background mode:

  * iOS background audio requires careful entitlement usage and user-visible behavior
* Push notifications:

  * Must be reliable in poor conference Wi-Fi; fallback options recommended

### 6.4 Scalability & Reliability

* Support large events: 1,000+ concurrent tables (stretch)
* Horizontal scaling for:

  * Session orchestration
  * Streaming ingestion
  * ASR workers
  * NLP summarization workers
* Graceful degradation:

  * If AI pipeline delays, still capture audio and backfill summary later

---

## 7) High-Level System Architecture (Suggested)

**React Native App (Facilitator)**

* Audio capture (native)
* Local VAD (voice activity detection) + compression
* Secure streaming client
* Local UI summary updates (from server)

**Backend Services**

1. **Session Orchestrator**

   * Validates join codes, issues tokens
   * Tracks table state, device membership
2. **Streaming Ingestion**

   * Receives audio streams, handles buffering
3. **ASR Service**

   * Streaming transcription (provider or self-hosted)
4. **De-ID / PII Scrubber**

   * Real-time redaction pass + configurable policies
5. **Insight Engine**

   * Theme clustering, action items, questions, sentiment/pulse
6. **Admin APIs + Web App**

   * Monitoring, nudges, exports
7. **Data Store**

   * Event metadata, transcripts, insights, audit logs
8. **Integration Layer**

   * Slack/Notion/Salesforce connectors, webhooks

---

## 8) User Stories (Key Workflows)

### Admin Stories

1. **Create event with many sessions**

   * As an admin, I can create an event with multiple sessions and bulk-import table topics so setup is fast.
   * **Acceptance:** import validates errors; generates codes/QRs per table.

2. **Monitor table health**

   * As an admin, I can see which tables are active, degraded, or offline so I can intervene.
   * **Acceptance:** health reflects last audio/transcript time; alerts after threshold.

3. **Send nudge to a subset**

   * As an admin, I can send “5 minutes left” to Session B only.
   * **Acceptance:** delivery stats visible; facilitators see banner within seconds.

4. **Review and export insights safely**

   * As an admin, I can review redactions and export to Slack/Notion/Salesforce.
   * **Acceptance:** export respects permission scope; audit log created.

### Facilitator Stories

1. **Join with no login**

   * As a facilitator, I can enter a code and start capturing in <20 seconds.
   * **Acceptance:** minimal steps; clear “connected” state.

2. **Stay on guide**

   * As a facilitator, I see my discussion prompts and a timer so I can keep the group on track.
   * **Acceptance:** prompts are readable, tappable sections, minimal scrolling.

3. **Use live summary**

   * As a facilitator, I can glance at a live summary to reflect and steer the conversation.
   * **Acceptance:** summary updates periodically; shows confidence/“last updated”.

4. **Receive nudges**

   * As a facilitator, I see time warnings and prompt shifts without leaving the session screen.
   * **Acceptance:** banner appears, optionally requires one-tap acknowledgment.

### Attendee/Sponsor Stories (Recommended)

1. **Browse insights**

   * As an attendee, I can review themes and action items from sessions I attended.
2. **Search**

   * As a sponsor, I can filter insights by topic track and sentiment to understand market feedback.

---

## 9) Edge Cases & Failure Modes

* **Noisy room / cross-talk:** degrade summary confidence, encourage second device placement
* **Capture ALL transcripts from the tables in raw format as well. Allow admins to download all raw transcripts
* **Poor Wi-Fi:** local buffering + delayed backfill; admin sees degraded status
* **Mic permission denied:** fallback onboarding to re-enable; cannot proceed without mic
* **Facilitator swap mid-session:** allow “handoff” code to new device, maintain continuity
* **Privacy-sensitive events:** strict mode, no audio retention, attendee dashboard disabled

---

## 10) Smart Additions to “Wow” Users

1. **Auto-generated “Session Closing Script”** for facilitators based on live themes (“Here’s what I’m hearing…”)
2. **Real-time cross-table synthesis** (“Top 5 themes across all roundtables right now”)
3. **Confidence & provenance UX**: show *why* a theme is trending (redacted evidence snippets)
4. **Insight assignments**: convert action items into tasks (Asana/Jira) post-event
5. **Gamified facilitator quality signals**: “You covered 4/5 prompts” (private to facilitator)
6. **Role-based dashboards**: sponsor-safe view vs internal-only view with deeper detail
7. **Multilingual mode**: translate summaries into event’s primary language for global audiences
8. **Event Insights Article**: automatically generate an event insights article written like a reporter who is trying to educate an audience from what they learned from the session.
